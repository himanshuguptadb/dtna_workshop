  "paper_conclusions": "We presented SayCan, a method that enables leveraging and grounding the rich knowledge in large language models to complete embodied tasks. For real-world grounding, we leverage pre-trained skills, which are then used to condition the model to choose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. More specifically, we use reinforcement learning as a way to learn value functions for the individual skills that provide affordances of what is possible in the world, and then use textual labels for these skills as potential responses that are scored by a language model. This combination results in a symbiotic relationship where the skills and their value functions can act as the language model’s “hands and eyes,” while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about how to complete a task. We evaluated the proposed approach on a number of real-world robotic tasks that involve a mobile manipulator robot accomplishing a large set of long-horizon natural language instructions in a real kitchen. We also demonstrated an exciting property of our method where a robot’s performance can be improved simply by enhancing the underlying language model."
